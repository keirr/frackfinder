Frack Finder is an image recognition problem for fracking sites that consists of several phases.

1. Categorizing

   The first phase presents map images and asks whether a frack site is present. The user may answer: Yes, No,
   Don't Know. If the user answers "Yes", he or she is asked "Is this an active drill permit", with the same 
   selection of answers

Based on the answer of the users, we will be able to classify the photos,
distributing the tasks (thanks to PyBossa) to different users and volunteers.
